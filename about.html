        People deserve a second chance. Especially those who have been falsely
        imprisoned, or have reformed while in prison. A person who is remain
        true to themselves, and not let the environment of prison control who
        they are is someone with excellent mental fortitude, and contains the
        dedication to themselves that would make them above average employees.

            Everyone loves the story of a comeback. Of someone successfully
            being able to beat the odds and improve their favor. We love seeing
            it in our news , seeing it in movies, we love sharing these stories
            to inspire others. But, when have you or your organization ever had
            the chance to be a crucial player in these stories. What if, could
            lead the underdog to victory? (temp text, not sure if this is a
            message I want to go with).

            A benefits package of any sort is not required to hire inmates they
            get all of their healthcare needs provided to them by the state and
            that means less money out of your pocket and more that you can
            invest back into the company.

            Inmates will be held to just as high of a standard as any other
            employee and always have a reliable form of transportation provided
            by the state so you won't have to worry about them ever being late.
